# Predicting NASDAQ indexes during the covid-19 pandemic
## Introduction
Covid-19, the most significant "black swan incident" in 2020, seemed to add huge uncertainties to the stock market unprecedently. Here we propose to study whether we can predict the seemingly strongly covid-related NASDAQ indexes: Healthcare and Biotechnology, using several measurements of the covid situation. We will first use the baseline AR-1 model proposed in the paper to forecast the closing values of the two NASDAQ indexes. Then we will analyze another three predictors including the number of newly-confirmed covid cases, the Google Trends on the topic "Vaccine", and the government response index in the model to evaluate if the prediction could be improved. If so, we will further explore the sensitivity of the NASDAQ indexes to these predictors. If not, we may have to adopt other models that are more suitable for this application. This will help to understand to what extent the covid-related news is influencing the stock market.

## How does AR-1 model performs on predicting NASDAQ indexes?
## Will the addtion of Google trends data of 'Vaccine' improve the model?
## How about daily new covid-10 cases/deaths?
## Adding more intreseting trends topics
## Among all the google trends categories, which are most likely to be included in AR-1 model to maximize the performance?
## Conclusion
